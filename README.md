# üêöBash-scripting #
> _In this repository, I‚Äôve created three simple Bash scripts designed to run as cron jobs. I hope this repo serves as a practical and insightful resource for learning Bash scripting and basic job automation in Linux._

## What is Bash?? ##
Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a scripting language used to interact with Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and WSL. 

## What Bash can be used for? ##
- Task Automation
- File Management and Directory
- System Management

## What is CronJob? ##
A CronJob is a feature or utility that allows automated and scheduled tasks to run on Unix-based operating systems such as Linux.

## How CronJob work? ##
1 Crontab (Cron Table) ‚Äì Used to schedule and configure tasks that should be executed at specific times or intervals.
2 Cron Daemon (crond) ‚Äì Runs in the background and continuously monitors the crontab file to determine which tasks need to be executed.
3 Automatic Execution ‚Äì When the scheduled time arrives, the Cron Daemon automatically runs the specified task or script in the background

## Cron Format ##
```markdown
* * * * * command_to_run
```
(minute, hour, day in a month, day in a week)

### Examples ###
```markdown
* 7 * * * command_to_run
```
Running the script on **7am**

```markdown
/15 * * * * command_to_run
```
Running the script **every 15 minutes**

## Scripts Explaination : ##
### **backup.sh** ###
```
#!/bin/bash
```
Shebang, tells the system that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

```Bash
SOURCE="/home/fikri"
DEST="/home/backups"
DATE=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
FILENAME="backup-$DATE.tar.gz"
```
- source ‚Äì Specifies the directory that will be backed up.
- dest ‚Äì Defines the destination folder where the backup file will be stored.
- date ‚Äì Captures the current date and time to timestamp the backup operation.
- filename ‚Äì Sets the name of the backup file, typically including the date and time to ensure uniqueness and traceability.


```
mkdir -p $DEST
```
Making sure the backup folder exists

```
tar -czvf $DEST/$FILENAME $SOURCE
```
Create compressed archive from $SOURCE to $DEST/$FILENAME using tar
- -c = create archive
- -z = compress gzip
- -v = verbose(showing the list of file when processed)
- -f = file name output

```
find $DEST -type f -name "backup-*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
```
Finding file in $DEST, 
-type f = making sure that we are looking for file only
-name *backup-*.tar.gz = making sure that the file contain name "backup-" and have .tar.gz extension
-mtime +7 = created more than 7x24 hour
-exec rm {} \; = run "rm" command for every result

```
echo "Backup complete! File : $DEST/$FILENAME"
```
Print out the file path of the backup

### **auto_update.sh** ###
```
#!/bin/bash
```
Shebang, tells the system that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

```
echo "üöÄ System update started..." | wall
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
echo "‚úÖ System up-to-date!" | wall
```
Doing update using apt (Advanced Package Tool) / Debian-based Linux distributions.
- update = update or sync package list
- full-upgrade = upgrade all including packages that needs new dependency
- autoremove = deletes all old or unused packages

###  **check_disk.sh** ###
```
#!/bin/bash
```
Shebang, tells the system that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

```
THRESHOLD=80
```
THRESHOLD = Initiate the THRESHOLD number, the amound of usage that needs to be alreted

```
USAGE=$(/bin/df -h / | grep '/' | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
```
Find out the current amount of disk usage by running df -h command
- df         = means _disk free_ , showing current disk usage
- -h         = means _human readable_ , so the output using M(mega), G(giga) measurement
- | grep '/' = filter a line that includes "/" which contain the number of disk percentage
- | awk      = break the line to become columns based on spaces
- '{print $5}' = take the fifth column from the left
- sed 's/%//'= stream editor that deletes % symbol
- USAGE=$(_) = save the final result to USAGE variable

```
if [ $USAGE -ge $THRESHOLD ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Disk usage reach $USAGE%"| wall
fi
```
- if ...; then  = Bash conditional structure. Run the code block if it's true
- $USAGE        = Disk usage percentage
- -ge           = numeric comparison operator, greater than or equal
- $THRESHOLD    = The amound of usage that needs to be alreted

Example output in linux terminal

## Crontab ##
```
* * * * * /home/backups/backup.sh >> /tmp/testcron.log 2>&1
@reboot /home/fikri/scripts/auto_update.sh >> /home/fikri/log/update/update.log 2>&1
* * * * * /home/fikri/scripts/check_disk.sh >> /home/fikri/log/disk/disk.log 2>&1
```

Unfortunately, crontab doesn‚Äôt display the backup or update process in real time. The output can only be viewed through the log file specified in the crontab configuration
